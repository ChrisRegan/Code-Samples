Hello this is Christopher Regan's repository of Code Samples for the purpose of creating a resume.

It is categorized by game engines I worked on than to a sample project. Basic instructions to play the sample game is going to be in each sample project.

More will be added as time allows to hopefully more engines and more complex sample projects.
